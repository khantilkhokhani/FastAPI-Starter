# Python Best Practices

## Project Structure

- Organize code in a hierarchical package structure
- Separate source code from tests using a `tests` directory
- Use a `main.py` or `__main__.py` for application entry points
- Keep configuration in a dedicated module or use environment variables
- Use `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py` for package management
- Include documentation in a `docs` directory
- Maintain a clear `README.md` with setup and usage instructions

## Code Organization

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use consistent naming conventions (snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes)
- Keep functions and methods small and focused
- Group related functionality into classes or modules
- Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods
- Use type hints to improve code readability and enable static type checking
- Separate concerns with proper abstraction layers

## Dependency Management

- Use virtual environments for project isolation
- Manage dependencies with requirements.txt or poetry
- Specify version constraints for dependencies
- Use dependency groups for development, testing, and production
- Pin exact versions in deployment environments
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Document dependency purposes in requirements files

## Error Handling

- Use specific exception types instead of generic exceptions
- Implement proper exception hierarchies for your application
- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level
- Log exceptions with contextual information
- Provide helpful error messages for debugging
- Use context managers (`with` statements) for resource management
- Validate inputs early to prevent cascading errors

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all functionality
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Organize tests to mirror the application structure
- Implement integration tests for component interactions
- Use fixtures for test setup and teardown
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Implement parameterized tests for edge cases
- Use TDD (Test-Driven Development) when appropriate

## Asynchronous Programming

- Use `async`/`await` for I/O-bound operations
- Properly manage async contexts and resources
- Use `asyncio` for concurrent operations
- Implement proper exception handling in async code
- Use appropriate event loops
- Consider thread safety in mixed sync/async code
- Use async libraries for networking and database operations

## Performance Optimization

- Profile code before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures for operations
- Implement caching for expensive computations
- Use generators for memory-efficient data processing
- Consider using NumPy/Pandas for numerical operations
- Optimize database queries and implement connection pooling
- Use multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate

## Security

- Never store credentials in code
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for secrets
- Implement proper input validation
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Sanitize data for template rendering
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid vulnerabilities
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all external communications

## Logging

- Use the built-in logging module
- Configure appropriate log levels
- Include contextual information in log messages
- Implement structured logging for machine parsing
- Configure different handlers for different environments
- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Rotate log files to manage disk space
- Implement proper error tracking

## Documentation

- Write clear docstrings with examples
- Document function parameters and return types
- Generate API documentation with tools like Sphinx
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Include usage examples
- Document architectural decisions
- Maintain a changelog for version history
- Create installation and setup guides

## Best Practices

- Follow the Zen of Python (PEP 20)
- Write code for readability
- Use list/dict comprehensions when appropriate
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Use context managers for resource cleanup
- Avoid global mutable state
- Make use of Python's standard library
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Implement proper serialization/deserialization methods
